### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript for functionality

### What I learned

During the HTML portion of the project, I learned the importance of using semantic tags to enhance accessibility for screen readers. In CSS, I gained a deeper understanding of Flexbox and built the entire project using it, which significantly enhanced my experience and confidence in working with Flexbox. Additionally, I successfully embedded JavaScript into the project to enable its functionality. Overall, this project has boosted my confidence in building front-end projects.

### Continued development

I aim to significantly improve my JavaScript skills. To achieve this, I plan to take on more projects that require extensive use of JavaScript, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of how it functions. By working on diverse projects, I hope to encounter various challenges and scenarios where I can apply JavaScript in different ways. This hands-on experience will help me develop a proper and thorough knowledge of JavaScript, enhancing my ability to solve problems and create dynamic, interactive web applications.
In addition to practical projects, I will also study JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts through tutorials, online courses, and documentation. Combining theoretical knowledge with practical application will provide a comprehensive learning experience. By dedicating time and effort to mastering JavaScript, I am confident that I will become proficient in this essential programming language, which will be invaluable for my growth and success as a front-end developer.
